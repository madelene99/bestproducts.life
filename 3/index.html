<h1>Do those mosquito zapper things really work?</h1>

<h3>Ideally, you’d like to go outside and fire up the grill, or weed in the garden, without having a hoard of ferocious mosquitoes circling your head. Unfortunately, it usually doesn’t work out that way.</h3>
<p>Now before you panic and think to yourself, <i>That's it, I'm staying inside until winter with closed windows</i>, <b>there is a solution</b> to get rid of mosquitos in your living space without using dangerous chemicals. And the solution is animal friendly as well!</p>
<h2><strong>What Is It?</strong></h2>
          
                  <p>A Netherland-based startup company has come up with a new innovative and inexpensive device called <b><a href="http://mazl.trackthis.pw/click">Zap-Zap Mosquito Urn</a></b>, an insect death trap that works both indoors and outdoors. </p>   


            <p>Company already has sold over <b>1 000 000 units</b> in Europe and Asia and by the end of May they started selling it in USA.
</p>

            <h2><strong>How Does It Work?</strong></h2>
                                                                 
<p><b><a href="http://mazl.trackthis.pw/click">Zap-Zap Mosquito Urn</a></b> attracts mosquitos with a 360-400nm UV light, which places them over a mesh that they are drawn through by a vortex that is created by a fan at the bottom of the device (<i>The fan so quiet that it wouldn’t even wake up an infant</i>). 
</p>           

            <p>The same airflow keeps them pinned to the bottom of the urn <b>until they perish from drying and dehydration</b>.</p>
            <div style="padding:100% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/271243970" width="640" height="640" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> 

            <br><p>The storage box <b>takes a couple of seconds to clean</b>, and the device is easy to maintain altogether.
 

</p>
            <p>Device is powered by USB cable, so you can even connect it to PC, notebook, power bank or other devices with USB port to work (<b>especially useful when you are outdoor!</b>). It doesn’t consume a lot of power, so the urn can work for several days in a row with a simple powerbank.</p>
            <p>It’s <b>low-voltage</b>, <b>durable</b>, and <b>doesn’t involve chemicals</b>, so any conceivable health hazards are out of the way from the get-go.
</p>
            <p>Don’t worry about forgetting to turn the urn off, because it’s equipped with a <b>light-triggered sensor</b> that turns the device on at dusk and off at dawn.</p> 
            <p>Also, minimalistic device design will look good in home.</p>

With so many mosquitoes caught in one night, it is really safe, but it is only a light mosquito catcher. It is no longer afraid of the baby to touch and it is waterproof and can be washed in water</i></div><i>
